```



## Exercise 1

```{r ex1a, out.width="80%"}
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

#statistics calculations code

run17%>% filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
         filter(age <20)

run17 %>% filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
         filter( age > 75)

run17 %>% filter(event == "10 Mile") %>%
          summarise( min_age = min(age),
                    max_age = max(age))
  
```


#1a
There is very few runners aged below 20,only 169, the majority of runners are aged between early 20's to late 40's, shown by a mean of 37. There is a steady decrease of runners past the age 42 until very few run at the oldest age of 85. The youngest runner was 11 and the oldest runner was 85.  


```{r ex1b, out.width="80%"}
# Write your code for Ex1b here
run17 %>%
  filter(event == "5K") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

#statistics calculations code

run17 %>% filter(event == "5K") %>% 
  filter(age < 20) %>%
  arrange(desc(age))

run17%>% filter(event == "5K") %>% 
         filter(age>75)

```


#1b
In the 5K event there were less runners under 20. In the 5K event there was only 110 runners under 20 compared to 169 runners in the 10 Mile event. In the 5K event there were a lot fewer runners who were over the age of 75. In the 10 Mile event there was 11 runners aged over 75 compared to only 7 runners in the 5K event. The youngest in the 5K run was 6, however the youngest runner in the 10 Mile run was 11. The oldest runner in the 5K event was 92, however the oldest runner in the 10 Mile event was 85. This means that the 5K event had the oldest and youngest runner. The majority if runners in both the 5K event and the 10 Mile event were aged between 20 and 40. In the 5K event there were a lot less runners who attended, only 2519, compared to 17442 runners in the 10 Mile event. 


## Exercise 2

```{r ex2, out.width = "80%"}
# Write your code to answer exercise 2a here

library(lubridate)
run17 %>% mutate(minute(seconds_to_period(net_sec)))



ggplot(data = run17,
       mapping = aes(
         x = minute(seconds_to_period(net_sec)),
        y = event
       )) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    x = "time to complete race (minutes)" ,
    y = "event" , 
    
    title = "The time it took the runners to complete the event"
  ) +
  facet_grid(event ~ sex,
             scale = "free")



```

#2b
The female runners have a higher median than the male runners in the 10 Mile event. The female runners again have a slightly higher median than the male runners in the 5K event. The difference in the median between males and females in greater in the 10 Mile event than in the 5K event. There was a wider range of results (the time taken to complete the race) in the 10 Mile event than in the 5K event.
